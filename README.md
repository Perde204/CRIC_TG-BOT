Description of the bot: Hello! I have created a Telegram bot that helps users learn programming by offering interesting learning tasks. 
My bot can process commands, provide help, and even respond to incorrect messages. 
This is a great assistant for anyone who wants to improve their programming skills.
Libraries used:
asyncio: Provides asynchronous programming for smooth operation of the bot.
logging: It keeps an event log to monitor the bot's work processes.
random: Selects random tasks from the list of tasks for users.
aiogram: The main library for developing Telegram bots.
Bot, Dispatcher: To create a bot and manage its events.
types: For working with Telegram object types.
DefaultBotProperties: Allows you to set settings, such as using HTML to format text.
Message: Handles incoming messages from users.
Command: Filters commands in messages.
Bot functionality:
The /start command: Welcomes the user and explains the main features of the bot.
Command /help: Shows a list of available commands to help you figure it out.
Command /task: Generates a random programming task from a pre-prepared list.
Message processing: If the user enters an incorrect query, the bot offers to use the /help command.
Bot operation: My bot is running on an asynchronous platform, which allows it to respond to user requests without delay.
I have set it up so that it is simple, useful and convenient for those who study programming.
